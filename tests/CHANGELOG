lldpd (0.5.0)

  * Features:
    + lldpd can now handle several systems on the same port. This
      modification also allows to speak to a switch using CDP and LLDP
      for example.
    + The way that lldpd gathers information for each port has been
      abstracted. This should allow to support more systems (BSD for
      examples) or switch cores in the future. Sending/receive support
      is also abstracted.
    + Add "-k" switch to avoid to emit too much information on running
      kernel.
    + Support of ifAlias with kernel >= 2.6.28
    + Lot of portability stuff. lldpd can now be compiled on RHEL
      2.1. Still Linux-only though.
    + Add an option to specify AgentX socket (-X).
    + Add some unit tests
    + lldpctl has been reworked; it is now able to output data in XML
      format for easier parsing. Patches were provided by Andreas
      Hofmeister.

  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix EDP VLAN handling
    + Silent warnings about bridge stuff.
    + Copy /etc/localtime into chroot before starting lldpd daemon to
      ensure correct timestamps for logs.

lldpd (0.4.1)

  * Fix EDP handling when there is no VLAN
  * Fix CDP version to not always be 1
  * Misc fix:
     + incorrect number of arguments for a LLOG_INFO call
     + fix SNMP last change in case this change occurs before start time

lldpd (0.4)

  * Rewrite of packet builder and parser to be able to cope with
    architecture that cannot do unaligned read. For decoder, we don't
    cast structures any more since they can be unaligned. For encoder,
    we use memcpy through the use of macro that build packets step by
    step.

lldpd (0.3.2)

  * Fix LLDP-MED support

lldpd (0.3.1)

  * Misc fixes, including memory leaks

lldpd (0.3)

  * Initial support of LLDP-MED
  * Fix for bridge detection (don't send bridge ioctl on random interfaces)
  * For bonded devices, get the real hardware address. For inactive
    slaves, transmit using a random MAC address.

lldpd (0.2.1)

  * Fix a syntax error in manual page
  * Fix open() calls

lldpd (0.2)

  * Add privilege separation
  * Add FDP support
  * Support CDP encapsulated into native VLAN
  * Various fixes

lldpd (0.1)

  * Initial release
